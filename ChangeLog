v2.1.0 - Access to dongle hw/sw/stack versions
14 May 2020

Example on how to do this can be found here:
https://github.com/Legrandgroup/libezsp/blob/8571574085160bc71177f68795f09b17b3c2ad7f/example/mainEzspStateMachine.h#L105

Note you should check that the libezsp library exports its NSEZSP::CLibEzspState state as NSEZSP::CLibEzspState::READY before you invoke NSEZSP::CEzsp::getAdapterVersion() or you might get an empty or incomplete version returned.

v2.0.0 - Library major re-architecture and full Green Power support
23 Apr 2020

Main re-architecture for file structure and classes, using a facade pattern to hide libezsp's internal from the user code.
Switching to cmake for build auto-configuration.
Building a shared libezsp library (also with an internal library for SPIs libezspspi), and adding a make install target also publishing header files.
Adding support for secure MSP channel request from GPDs, allowing channel request support with sensors (proprietary, secure, exchange).
Allowing to remove GPDs from mainEzspTest command-line arguments.
Adding an AES SPI (for a future compatibility with other third-party AES crypto libs).
Adding firmware upgrade mode feature and bootloader prompt escape capability.
Supporting full GP, including MIC validation.
Also adding CI using travils+sonarcloud and coverage checking using gcov.
Updating unit tests, using a mock serial SPI.
Added many command-line options to sample mainEzspTest.
Supports custom baudrates on adapter (including 115200 which is now the default)
Allowing on-host or offloaded (on-adapter) MIC calculation.
